### Warning! Because the API access to X (Formely Twitter) was disabled, this software doesn't work anymore and this repository will be archived

#### Disclaimer: The references to Russia in this program are because of the flimsy excuse some people would give when caught deleting their tweets: "Oh, I didn't delete it, that was a Russian hacker." I do not support Russia in any way.
